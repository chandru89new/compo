# Compo

Work in progress.

Small boilerplate/library for quick mobile UI. 

This is not aimed as a complete framework / design library. This is more of a starting point for designers / design-specific coders. If you're using this, you're encouraged to modify ```compo.css``` to suit your design needs (like, colors, padding, font-sizes etc.)

## Demo

Demo at http://druchan.com/compo/demo/

## Upcoming / to-do
